# Smappio

Wireless electronic sthetoscope developed by using Adafruit Feather Huzzah ESP32 module along with Adafruit I2S SPH0645 to capture body sounds (heart and lungs mainly). 

The HW folder contains all the C/C++ (Arduino) for the hardware, and the SW contains two clients projects that connects via WiFi to the device. Those project were develop with .NET Winforms and Android respectivly. 

Hope this project could help anyone else.
